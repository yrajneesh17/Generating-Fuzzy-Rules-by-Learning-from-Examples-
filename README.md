# Generating-Fuzzy-Rules-by-Learning-from-Examples-
This paper describes a general method to generate fuzzy rules from numerical data. This method is known as the Numerical Fuzzy approach.
In this paper both neural and expert system approach are combined to give the Numerical Fuzzy approach. Expert system comprises of 
“IF-THEN” rules and Neural approach comprises of training the network from data pairs. This is done to replace strongly non-linear
controller by numerical fuzzy controller. Numerical fuzzy controller does not require high training time as of Neural based controller.
Both neural and Expert linguistic rules alone are incomplete because they cannot cover all the situations that the control system face.
Combination of these kinds of information is sufficient for the successful design of the controller. Section 3 deals with the application
of the numerical fuzzy approach to design a controller for Truck Backer Upper problem.\
A five step procedure is proposed to generate fuzzy rules from numerical data and obtain a mapping from input space to output space . 
These five steps are defined as follows:\
Step 1: Divide the input output space of the given numerical data into fuzzy regions\
Step 2: Generating Fuzzy Rules from Given 14 Data Pairs\
Step 3: Assign a Degree to Each Rule\
Step 4: Create a Combined Fuzzy Rule base\
Step 5: Determine a Mapping Based on the Combined Fuzzy Rule Base\
